## persisting problems 

- unable to target textarea when editing page titles to get it consistent, so it's switching between serif display and avenir sans-serif when editing, pretty annoying
- how to target "unlinked reference" title separately from everything else. it's too bright in dark theme
- 

## styling wishlist

- replacing bullet-points with icons from https://tabler-icons.io/
